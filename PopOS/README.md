	- System76 is an American computer manufacturer founded by **Carl Richell** and **Erik Fetzer** In 2003 to sell computers with ***Linux*** operating systems preinstalled.
		
	- In 2005 all computers that shipped from System76 came out of the box with Ubuntu preinstalled, and this is **very important** information.

	- But in ***2017*** System76 decided to make a **BIG** change in their computer lineup and the ___Linux___ community; they decided to make their distribution the best distribution ever "**at least in my opinion**", they called it Pop!\_OS, and beginning from that moment they shipped all there computers with it.

- ### Based on distribution:
	- Now let's talk more in technical detail, do you remember when I told you that System76 shipped their computers from 2005 with Ubuntu, guess what is the base distribution of Pop!\_OS!!..... you are right, it's Ubuntu.

	- So, the question is why System76 decided to make their distribution!!?
	  after small research, it turns out that they want to make more simpler OS for both beginners and professionals but we will dive into this in the Intended Users section.

## Intended Users
- ### Real life use cases:
	- to answer on the question "__Isn’t Pop!\_OS just a re-skinned Ubuntu?__".... and the short answer is __NO__.
	
	- Pop!\_OS has been designed with vibrant colors, a flat theme, and a clean desktop environment, but developers created it to do so much more than just look pretty. (Although it does look very pretty.)
	
	- Pop!\_OS is designed to be:
		- **easy to use** for Linux beginners from the beginning to the end, also it's tech-savvy professional.

			- systemd-boot bootloader and the automatic configuration tool System76 have created for it called kernelstub replace the outdated GRUB bootloader used on Ubuntu.   

- ### Cases where it might not be beneficial to use this specific distribution.
	- In my humble opinion you **don't** need Pop!\_OS in case you are not: 
		- Software Engineer 
		- ML&DL researcher
		- Bioinformatics Engineer
		- Media Production man
		- Gamer
		- regular user
	- if you are not one of the above, you may not need Pop!\_OS... but give it a try.
