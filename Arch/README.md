# What is Arch Linux
Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose [GNU](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNU)/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.
# Arch History
Judd Vinet, a Canadian programmer, began developing Arch Linux in early 2001, The name was chosen because Vinet liked the word's meaning of "the principal," as in "arch-enemy". Its first formal release, Arch Linux 0.1, was on March 11, 2002. 

Vinet led Arch Linux until 1 October 2007, when he stepped down due to lack of time, transferring control of the project to Aaron Griffin. On 24 February 2020, Aaron Griffin announced that due to his limited involvement with the project, he would, after a voting period, transfer control of the project to Levente Polyak. This change also led to a new 2-year term period being added to the Project Leader position. 

In March 2021, Arch Linux developers were thinking of porting Arch Linux packages to x86_64-v3, roughly correlating to the Intel Haswell era of processors.

In April 2021, Arch Linux installation images began including a guided installation script by default. 

In late 2021, the Arch Linux developers released Pacman 6.0, which enabled parallel downloads. 

In February 2022, the Arch Linux developers began offering debug packages.
