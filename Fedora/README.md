## Distribution History
---
Fedora Linux or ___"Fedora"___ is an **Open_source Linux** distribution that was released in **6 November 2003**. It was originally developed as a continuation of [Red Hat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) project.
Although Fedora is not as stable as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), but it is completely free to use and full of innovations, unlike Red Hat that is typically sold through an annual subscription.

[Tom Kunz](https://www.trustradius.com/reviews/fedora-linux-2021-06-29-11-16-36) ~ a Solid Rock Technologies Engineer: 
**"Fedora is excellent for test-lab/R&D deployment"**
We have had Fedora Linux in testing for a while, and done some limited deployments. It's not our first-choice system, but it is definitely something we have used for certain applications and systems.

If you don't like changes and want a very stable distribution then Fedora will not be the best choice for you.
