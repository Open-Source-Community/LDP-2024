**Fedora Spins** are alternative versions of fedora like:
1. **[Fedora KDE PLASMA DESKTOP](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/)**: It is one of the oldest and most customizable desktop environments available for Linux

1. **[Fedora XFCE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/xfce/)**: It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and user friendly so, it is designed to run well on less powerful hardware.

1. **[Fedora CINAMMON](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/cinnamon/)**: Its layout is similar to GNOME 2 and the underlying technology is forked from GNOME Shell. It is known for delivering a high-end audiovisual experience with a fast and responsive interface.

1. **[Fedora MATE-COMPIZ](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/mate/)**: this spin bundles MATE Desktop with Compiz Fusion. MATE Desktop is a lightweight, powerful desktop designed with productivity and performance in mind. The default windows manager is Marco which is usable for all machines and VMs. Compiz Fusion is a beautiful 3D windowing manager with Emerald and GTK+ theming. It was developed as a reaction to the Linux communityâ€™s mass rejection of changes introduced in GNOME 3. The MATE team decided to fork GNOME 2 into another project that would preserve the GNOME 2 experience that so many users wanted.

1. **[Fedora i3](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/i3/)**: This spin is good for users who prefer not to use a mouse, touchpad, or other pointing device to interact with their environment.

1. **[Fedora LXDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/lxde/)**: Stands for *"Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment"* and the main goal of LXDE is to keep computer resource usage low. It is especially designed for computers with low hardware specifications like netbooks, mobile device. 

1. **[Fedora LXQT](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/lxqt/)**: It provides a small, well selected collection of applications like the Falkon browser, which combines Chromium's rendering engine with a nice Qt experience. LXQt actually began as a spinoff from LXDE when the lead developer decided to try to recreate the desktop using the Qt libraries (which power KDE) instead of GTK. The experience on both desktops is very similar.

1. **[Fedora SOAS](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/soas/)**: Stands for *"Sugar on a Stick"* and it is is a highly specialized desktop designed for educational use with children. The system is simplified into games and puzzles that can be adjusted based on grade levels. It is especially well suited for use with touch screen devices.
