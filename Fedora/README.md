## Distribution History

---

Fedora Linux or **_"Fedora"_** is an **Open_source Linux** distribution that was released in **6 November 2003**. It was originally developed as a continuation of [Red Hat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) project.
Although Fedora is not as stable as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), but it is completely free to use and full of innovations, unlike Red Hat that is typically sold through an annual subscription.

## Flavors

---

**Fedora Spins** are alternative versions of fedora like:

1. **[Fedora KDE PLASMA DESKTOP](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/)**: It is one of the oldest and most customizable desktop environments available for Linux

1. **[Fedora XFCE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/xfce/)**: It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and user friendly so, it is designed to run well on less powerful hardware.

1. **[Fedora CINAMMON](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/cinnamon/)**: Its layout is similar to GNOME 2 and the underlying technology is forked from GNOME Shell. It is known for delivering a high-end audiovisual experience with a fast and responsive interface.

1. **[Fedora MATE-COMPIZ](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/mate/)**: this spin bundles MATE Desktop with Compiz Fusion. MATE Desktop is a lightweight, powerful desktop designed with productivity and performance in mind. The default windows manager is Marco which is usable for all machines and VMs. Compiz Fusion is a beautiful 3D windowing manager with Emerald and GTK+ theming. It was developed as a reaction to the Linux communityâ€™s mass rejection of changes introduced in GNOME 3. The MATE team decided to fork GNOME 2 into another project that would preserve the GNOME 2 experience that so many users wanted.

1. **[Fedora i3](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/i3/)**: This spin is good for users who prefer not to use a mouse, touchpad, or other pointing device to interact with their environment.

1. **[Fedora LXDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/lxde/)**: Stands for _"Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment"_ and the main goal of LXDE is to keep computer resource usage low. It is especially designed for computers with low hardware specifications like netbooks, mobile device.

1. **[Fedora LXQT](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/lxqt/)**: It provides a small, well selected collection of applications like the Falkon browser, which combines Chromium's rendering engine with a nice Qt experience. LXQt actually began as a spinoff from LXDE when the lead developer decided to try to recreate the desktop using the Qt libraries (which power KDE) instead of GTK. The experience on both desktops is very similar.

1. **[Fedora SOAS](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/soas/)**: Stands for _"Sugar on a Stick"_ and it is is a highly specialized desktop designed for educational use with children. The system is simplified into games and puzzles that can be adjusted based on grade levels. It is especially well suited for use with touch screen devices.

1. **[Fedora PHOSH](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/phosh/)**: This spin provides a mobile friendly, touch based desktop interface. It's built for mobile devices like phones and tablets, but also laptops with touchscreens. Phosh is built on wayland and other modern GNOME desktop technologies.

1. **[Fedora SWAY](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/sway/)**: This Spin offers a complete experience with a minimalist user interface. It makes Sway accessible and appealing to both novices and advanced users who prefer not to use a mouse, touchpad, or other pointing device to interact with their environment.

1. **[Fedora BUDGIE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/budgie/)**:Budgie Desktop uses common desktop design metaphors while offering users sophisticated functionality such as its Raven widget and notification center, and an approachable method to personalization.

## Real Life use case

[Tom Kunz](https://www.trustradius.com/reviews/fedora-linux-2021-06-29-11-16-36) ~ a Solid Rock Technologies Engineer:
**"Fedora is excellent for test-lab/R&D deployment"**
We have had Fedora Linux in testing for a while, and done some limited deployments. It's not our first-choice system, but it is definitely something we have used for certain applications and systems.
You can see more use cases [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/gx5i3b/what_are_the_real_use_cases_for_fedora/).

- Customizable.
- Flatpak is installed by default on Fedora.

## Its weaknesses :(

---

- Requires long time to install.
- Does not include proprietary software and software with usage restrictions.
