- ## History of Parrot Os
  - ### What is the ParrotOs?
	ParrotOs is a GNU/Linux distribution that is free and open-source, based on Debian stable, and specifically tailored for security experts, computer forensics, reverse engineering, hacking, penetration testing, anonymity, privacy, and cryptography. Developed by Frozenbox, it features MATE as the default desktop environment and offers a comprehensive portable toolkit for IT security and digital forensics tasks. In addition, it provides all the necessary tools for app development and online privacy protection. ParrotOs is offered in three editions: Security, Home, and Architect Editions, and can be used as a virtual machine on Raspberry Pi and Docker. Version 5.0 LTS has restored support for ARM systems (arm64 and armhf) and now includes images for boards like the Raspberry Pi. While the operating system comes with MATE Desktop environment pre-installed, users have the option to install alternative desktop environments.

  - ### What is the History of ParrotOs?
	Parrot Security OS is designed and developed by security expert Lorenzo "Palinuro" Faletra and a team of other security experts, open-source developers, digital rights advocates, and other Linux enthusiasts. The initial public launch was in April 2013. Parrot OS version 1.0, codenamed Hydrogen, was launched in July 2014.

	In September 2015, Parrot OS version 2.0, codenamed Helium, was released. In June 2016, the third version, codenamed Lithium, was released. In May 2018, version 4 was launched. The latest version of Parrot OS is 4.11, which was published in March 2021.

	As stated previously, Parrot OS is built on Debian, while the Parrot team considered moving to Devuan in 2017 owing to system issues, which were eventually resolved. The Parrot OS team stopped supporting 32-bit in January 2019 to focus their work on x64 and ARM. In August 2020, the XFCE Desktop environment (Home Edition) was officially supported, making the system lighter.
